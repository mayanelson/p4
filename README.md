# p4: NYC Higher or Lower by Yammers
### Overview: 
Inspired by the higher or lower game, our project will feature an interactive game where users compare two different neighborhoods based on an arbitrary data set. For each round, users will face a random order of data sets, such as the number of street trees, or teacher salaries, in two randomized boroughs around NYC. They will be asked to compare the two, with a question along the lines of “Which borough has more water fountains?” or “Which borough has a higher average firefighter salary?” After users answer a question, they will see an interactive map of NYC that shows the distribution of the data set across all boroughs in NYC. This will be done via different bubble sizes indicating higher amounts/densities. Thirteen unique datasets and nineteen unique questions are included and after the user strings together ten correct answers in a row, they are able to claim victory.
