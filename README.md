# p4: NYC Higher or Lower by Yammers
### Overview: 
Inspired by the higher or lower game, our project will feature an interactive game where users compare two different neighborhoods based on an arbitrary data set. For each round, users will face a predetermined order of data sets, such as the number of street trees, or teacher salaries, in two randomized boroughs or neighborhoods around NYC. They will be asked to compare the two, with a question along the lines of “Which neighborhood has more squirrels?” or “Which borough has a higher average teacher salary?” After users answer a question, they will see an interactive map of NYC that shows the data set across all neighborhoods in NYC. This will be done via different colors indicating higher amounts/densities. Around ten datasets will be included, and after ten rounds users will see their total percent correct and get a ranking of how well they know NYC!
